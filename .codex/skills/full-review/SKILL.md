# Skill: /full-review

Runs all five reviews: code errors, methodology concerns, AI skeptic audit, document number verification, and document–code consistency. Executes the RA's pipeline, discovers all source and document files in the target project, spawns all five sub-agents concurrently, and writes all five HTML reports to the `review-reports/` subdirectory of the target directory.

---

## Trigger

User runs `/full-review <target_dir>`

Example: `/full-review ~/ra-project`

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Parse target directory

Extract `target_dir` from the command argument. Expand `~` to the full home directory path.

If no argument is provided, stop and respond:

> Usage: `/full-review <path-to-project>`
> Example: `/full-review ~/ra-project`

Verify that `target_dir` exists and is a directory. If not:

> `<target_dir>` does not exist or is not a directory. Check the path and try again.

**Stop.**

### Step 2 — Detect and run the pipeline

Run the shared pipeline-detection procedure in `Infrastructure/rules/review-pipeline-runner.md`, substituting `<review-type>` = "full review".

If the pipeline fails, **stop and do not proceed to the review.** Do not spawn any sub-agents. If it succeeds ("Pipeline completed successfully."), continue to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Discover source code files

Recursively find all files matching these extensions inside `target_dir`:
- `*.py`
- `*.R`
- `*.Rmd`
- `*.qmd`
- `*.do`
- `*.ado`

Exclude files under these subdirectories (relative to `target_dir`):
- `.git/`

Collect the full absolute path of each discovered file.

If zero code files are found, stop and respond:

> No reviewable source files found in `<target_dir>`. Expected `.py`, `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`, `.do`, or `.ado` files.

### Step 4 — Discover document files

Search for document files in `target_dir` (recursively). Match these extensions:
- `*.tex`
- `*.md` (excluding files named `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and any files inside `.claude/` or `.codex/`)
- `*.qmd`
- `*.Rmd`
- `*.pdf` (excluding `doc-number-report.pdf`, `doc-consistency-report.pdf`)

Exclude files under `.git/`, `.claude/`, and `.codex/`.

Also exclude the `review-reports/` directory.

Record whether document files were found. If none are found, the document-review agents will be skipped (see Step 7).

### Step 5 — Report discovery and gather context

List the discovered files and ask for optional context in a single message:

> Found **N** source code files to review in `<target_dir>`:
>
> **Python (n):** `path/to/file.py`, …
> **R (n):** `path/to/file.R`, …
> **Stata (n):** `path/to/file.do`, …

If document files were found:

> Found **M** document file(s):
> `path/to/manuscript.tex`, `path/to/appendix.tex`, …

If multiple document files were found:

> Which document(s) should the number and consistency reviewers check? (Enter numbers separated by commas, "all", or "skip" to run only code and methodology reviews)

If no document files were found:

> No document files found (`.tex`, `.md`, `.qmd`, `.Rmd`, `.pdf`). Code and methodology reviews will proceed; number verification and consistency reviews will be skipped.

Always ask for optional research context:

> **Optional context** — helps the methodology and consistency reviewers give more targeted feedback (say "skip" to proceed):
>
> 1. **Identification strategy** (e.g., DiD, RD, IV, Matching) — or blank to infer
> 2. **Treatment variable** name
> 3. **Primary outcome variable(s)**
> 4. **Clustering level** (e.g., county, state, firm)

Wait for the user's response. Record any context provided and any document selection.

### Step 6 — Scan git history for AI authorship

If the directory is a git repository:

1. Run `git log --all --format='%H %s' --grep='Co-Authored-By'` to find AI-attributed commits.
2. Run `git log --all --numstat --format='%H' --diff-filter=A` to identify bulk-addition commits.
3. Map files to AI authorship status: Known / Suspected / Unknown.

If not a git repository, mark all files as "Unknown" AI authorship.

### Step 7 — Create output and temp directories

Create the output directory `<target_dir>/review-reports/` if it does not already exist:

```
mkdir -p <target_dir>/review-reports
mkdir -p <target_dir>/temp/ai-skeptic-tests
```

### Step 8 — Spawn sub-agents concurrently

**Spawn all applicable sub-agents at the same time (parallel).** Do not wait for one to finish before starting another.

**Always spawn these two:**

**Sub-agent 1 — code-reviewer:**
```
Agent: code-reviewer
Target directory: <target_dir>
Files to review: [full list of source code file paths]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/code-quality-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/code-error-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/code-error-report.html
```

**Sub-agent 2 — methodology-reviewer:**
```
Agent: methodology-reviewer
Target directory: <target_dir>
Files to review: [full list of source code file paths]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/methodology-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/methodology-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/methodology-report.html

Research context:
  Identification strategy: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Treatment variable: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Outcome variable(s): [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Clustering level: [user input or "Infer from code"]
```

**Always spawn (runs on source code and documents; does not require pipeline success):**

**Sub-agent 3 — ai-skeptic:**
```
Agent: ai-skeptic
Target directory: <target_dir>
Source files to review: [full list of source code file paths]
Document files to review: [full list of document file paths]
AI authorship map: [file → Known/Suspected/Unknown, from git history scan]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/ai-skeptic-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/ai-skeptic-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/ai-skeptic-report.html
Test script directory: <target_dir>/temp/ai-skeptic-tests/
```

**Spawn these two only if document files were found and selected:**

**Sub-agent 4 — data-consistency-reviewer:**
```
Agent: data-consistency-reviewer
Target directory: <target_dir>
Document files: [list of selected document file paths]
Code files to review: [full list of source code file paths]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/doc-number-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/doc-number-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/doc-number-report.html
```

**Sub-agent 5 — conceptual-consistency-reviewer:**
```
Agent: conceptual-consistency-reviewer
Target directory: <target_dir>
Document files: [list of selected document file paths]
Code files to review: [full list of source code file paths]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/doc-consistency-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/doc-consistency-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/doc-consistency-report.html

Research context:
  Identification strategy: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Treatment variable: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Outcome variable(s): [user input or "Infer from code"]
```

### Step 9 — Monitor all independently

Monitor all sub-agents independently. One agent's failure does not abort the others.

- If any agent fails, report its error but continue waiting for the others.
- If all fail, report all errors.

Inform the user as each sub-agent completes:

> Code reviewer complete (1/5) — waiting for remaining agents…
> Methodology reviewer complete (2/5) — waiting for remaining agents…
> AI skeptic complete (3/5) — waiting for remaining agents…
> Number verification complete (4/5) — waiting for consistency reviewer…
> All agents complete.

(Adapt the count to 3 if only code + methodology + AI skeptic agents were spawned.)

### Step 10 — Confirm outputs with combined summary

Once all sub-agents complete (or fail), report combined results:

> **Full review complete.**
>
> | Report | Status | Findings |
> |--------|--------|---------|
> | Code Errors (`review-reports/code-error-report.html`) | Complete / Failed | X CRITICAL, X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW, X INFO |
> | Methodology (`review-reports/methodology-report.html`) | Complete / Failed | X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW — Overall Risk: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |
> | AI Skeptic (`review-reports/ai-skeptic-report.html`) | Complete / Failed | X CRITICAL, X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW, X INFO — Trust: VERIFIED/CAUTION/SUSPECT |
> | Number Verification (`review-reports/doc-number-report.html`) | Complete / Failed / Skipped | X numbers extracted, Y verified, Z flagged — X CRITICAL, X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW, X INFO |
> | Consistency (`review-reports/doc-consistency-report.html`) | Complete / Failed / Skipped | X claims examined, Y consistent, Z flagged — X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW — Overall Risk: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |
>
> **Combined finding count:** N total across all reports.

If any CRITICAL or HIGH findings exist across any report:

> ⚑ **Action required:** [X] critical/high-severity issues found across [N] reports. Address these before submission.

### Step 11 — Offer key findings summary

Ask the user:

> Would you like me to summarize the most important findings from all reports here in chat? (Yes / No)

If yes, read all output HTML files and extract the CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings as a concise numbered list grouped by report:

**Code Errors — Critical/High:**
1. CE-001: [title] — [one-sentence description] (`file.py:line`)
2. …

**Methodology — High:**
1. MR-001: [title] — [one-sentence econometric concern] (`file.R`)
2. …

**Number Verification — Critical/High:**
1. DN-001: [title] — [one-sentence description] (`manuscript.tex`, Section X)
2. …

**Consistency — High:**
1. CC-001: [title] — [one-sentence inconsistency] (`manuscript.tex` vs `analysis.R`)
2. …

**AI Skeptic — Critical/High:**
1. AS-001: [title] — [one-sentence description] (`file.R`)
2. …

One line per finding. Omit MEDIUM and below (the full reports cover them). Skip any report section that has no Critical/High findings.
