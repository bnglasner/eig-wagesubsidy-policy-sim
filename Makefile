# parity-check verifies the structural relationships between canonical
# Infrastructure files and the generated adapter trees. It complements
# brain-check (which catches content drift) by catching structural gaps:
# missing adapter mirrors, orphan adapter files, uncovered metadata, and
# unapproved canonical-source duplications.

# maintenance-check delegates orchestration to a shell script that runs
# every underlying check, continues past failures, prints a summary, and
# exits non-zero if any check failed. Standalone targets above remain
# fail-fast — they're meant for debugging a single check in isolation.

# ARGS="--yes" to skip the confirmation prompt.
