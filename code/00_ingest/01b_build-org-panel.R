# wage-analysis sample gate (wage-and-salary workers, excluding the
# self-employed, with a valid weekly or hourly wage source), applies
# IPUMS sentinels to the wage and hours variables, imputes "hours vary"
# records via a per-year random forest, identifies topcoded weekly
# wages per the regime for each year, fits a sex-separate Pareto
# distribution by OLS on log-log binned data over the top 20 percent,
# replaces topcoded values with the fitted mean above topcode, runs
# the EPI rotation-group bridge for 2023m4 through 2024m12, and
# writes a year-partitioned ORG panel parquet with two EPI flag columns:
#   - pareto_topcode_imputed_flag : TRUE iff a Pareto imputation replaced
#                                   the topcoded wage; FALSE if left at
#                                   topcode.
#   - hours_imputed_flag          : TRUE iff a model-imputed hours value
#                                   replaced a "hours vary" (997) sentinel
#                                   in the primary usual-hours variable.
#
# Departure pointers (see drafts/decisions/ for full rationale):
#   - Departure #2 (no `1.5 * topcode` Pareto fallback):
#     drafts/decisions/decision_02_no_pareto_fallback.md.
#   - Departure #3 (retain BLS-allocated records, toggle
#     apply_allocation_flag_drop_bool below):
#     drafts/decisions/decision_03_retain_allocated_records.md.
#   - Departure #4 (random-forest hours imputation):
#     drafts/decisions/decision_04_random_forest_hours_imputation.md.
#   - Departure #6 (EPI rotation-group bridge for 2023m4-2024m12):
#     drafts/decisions/decision_06_epi_rotation_group_bridge.md.
#
# Allocation flags:
#   IPUMS-CPS harmonizes the BLS raw allocation flags into the Q-prefix
#   convention. With `data_quality_flags = TRUE` set on EARNWEEK and
#   HOURWAGE in 00a, IPUMS returns QEARNWEE (covers EARNWEEK and
#   EARNWEEK2) and QHOURWAG (covers HOURWAGE and HOURWAGE2). Code 0 =
#   unaltered; nonzero = edited or allocated. Step 1c computes the
#   SWA drop mask for diagnostic logging and applies it only when
#   apply_allocation_flag_drop_bool is TRUE. Jan 1994 - Aug 1995 is
#   retained without drop because the BLS allocation flags are absent
#   for that window.
#
#   Hours allocation flags (QUHRSWORKORG, QUHRSWORK1) are pulled by 00a
#   for diagnostic use; 01b does not drop on them. Hours-vary (code 997)
#   records are RF-imputed.
#
# Usual-hours handling:
#   Primary usual-hours variable is coalesce(UHRSWORK1, UHRSWORKORG).
#   UHRSWORK1 is preferred because it is defined on a wider sample.
#   Special codes on these variables (IPUMS CPS):
#     - UHRSWORK1          : 997 = "Hours vary", 999 = NIU.
#                            (99 is a legitimate topcoded value: 99+ hours.)
#                            NOTE: despite the IPUMS "main job (1994+)" label,
#                            IPUMS populates this column from 1982 in this ORG
#                            extract -- before 1994 it carries the earner-study
#                            usual hours for ALL ORG earners (the data EPI reads
#                            from `ernush`), so salaried workers have usable
#                            hours back to 1982. Verified ~99.9% coverage for
#                            salaried earners 1983-1993 (temp/hours_coverage_probe.py).
#     - UHRSWORKORG        : 997 = "Hours vary", 998 = "Don't know",
#                            999 = NIU. Hourly-paid only and begins in 1989;
#                            it is NOT a salaried-hours source in any year.
#   Values >= 997 in either variable become NA before use in denominators.
#   Each row with missing primary hours is classified by reason (vary =
#   997, dont_know = UHRSWORKORG 998, niu = 999, other_missing); rows whose
#   reason is in hours_impute_reasons_chr (default: vary + dont_know) are
#   RF-imputed. NIU is excluded by default -- for salaried workers
#   UHRSWORKORG is NIU by construction (defined only for hourly-paid ORG
#   earners), so a salaried NIU on hours is a structural universe artifact,
#   not random non-response. The unimputed residual is logged to
#   hours_missingness_diagnostics.csv.
#
# Wage sentinels (IPUMS-encoded cent-level magic numbers, applied to the
# canonical wage columns before the sample gate):
#     - HOURWAGE / HOURWAGE2   : >= 999.99 -> NA
#     - EARNWEEK (pre-2023)    : >= 9999.99 -> NA
#     - EARNWEEK2 (2023+)      : >= 999999.99 -> NA
#
# Pareto fit notes:
#   - OLS on a log-log binned empirical tail with an 80th-percentile
#     threshold, sex-separate fit. Mathematically equivalent to current
#     EPI `epiextracts/code/ado/topcode_impute.ado`; the EIG implementation
#     differs only in bin layout (log-spaced bins between p80 and the
#     topcode vs. EPI's fixed $50-wide bins) and dependent variable form
#     (log empirical survival vs. log cumulative count). Not a departure.
#   - The fit INCLUDES topcoded rows (binned at the topcode mass), and
#     the survival estimate at each bin is EARNWT-weighted, mirroring EPI.
#   - No `1.5 * topcode` fallback (Departure #2).
#   - If OLS cannot be fit for a sex-year cell, topcoded values are
#     left at the topcode and pareto_topcode_imputed_flag is FALSE.
#
# No custom functions are defined. All transformations are inline.

# Topcode regime handling.
#
# Two-regime resolution strategy:
#   - Legacy years (1982-2022): use the documented EARNWEEK topcode
#     value from `legacy_topcode_lookup_df` directly ($999 for
#     1982-88, $1923 for 1989-97, $2884.60 for 1998-2022). Mirrors
#     EPI `epiextracts/code/variables/generate_weekpay.do`, which
#     hard-codes the topcode by date band. Empirical detection on
#     `nominal_weekly_wage_num` does not work for these years because
#     hourly workers' HOURWAGE * hours products produce outlier maxima
#     far above the EARNWEEK topcode mass.
#   - Post-legacy years (>= 2023): empirical mass-point detection at
#     the max of `nominal_weekly_wage_num`. BLS's dynamic top-3 %
#     weighted-average topcode in the *2 era produces a real mass at
#     the max.
#
# `topcoded_bool` is restricted to NON-HOURLY workers whose EARNWEEK
# is at the resolved topcode within $0.01. Hourly workers at the
# HOURWAGE topcode are NOT Pareto-adjusted, matching EPI
# (`generate_weekpay.do` applies the Pareto only to `weekpay_noadj`).
#
# Pareto scope is bounded by pareto_max_year_int. For 2023-2024, the
# fit uses the legacy $2,884.60 as the analytical threshold; the
# rotation-group bridge then overwrites the BLS-topcoded subset for
# 2023m4-2024m12. Years beyond 2024 skip the fit entirely.

#   "dont_know" -- ORG usual hours "Don't know" (UHRSWORKORG == 998)
#   "niu"       -- not in universe (UHRSWORKORG or UHRSWORK1 == 999)
# Default is c("vary", "dont_know"): the don't-know extension brings
# salaried workers who would otherwise drop out of the hourly series back
# in via a model-imputed hours value. "niu" is INTENTIONALLY excluded: for
# salaried (PAIDHOUR == 1) workers UHRSWORKORG is not-in-universe by
# construction (it is defined only for hourly-paid ORG earners; see
# https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/UHRSWORKORG), so a salaried
# NIU on hours is a structural universe artifact, not random non-response,
# and the RF -- trained only on workers who DO report hours -- would
# fabricate a value. To revert to the prior production behavior, set this
# to c("vary"). Changing this vector changes the reported hourly series and
# REQUIRES a validation rerun plus the 10_epi_spot_checks gate before
