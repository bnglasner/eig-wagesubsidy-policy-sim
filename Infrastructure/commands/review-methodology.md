# Skill: /review-methodology

Runs the methodology review only. Executes the RA's pipeline, discovers all source files in the target project, spawns the `methodology-reviewer` sub-agent, and writes `methodology-report.html` to the `review-reports/` subdirectory of the target directory.

---

## Trigger

User runs `/review-methodology <target_dir>`

Example: `/review-methodology ~/ra-project`

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Parse target directory

Extract `target_dir` from the command argument. Expand `~` to the full home directory path.

If no argument is provided, stop and respond:

> Usage: `/review-methodology <path-to-project>`
> Example: `/review-methodology ~/ra-project`

Verify that `target_dir` exists and is a directory. If not:

> `<target_dir>` does not exist or is not a directory. Check the path and try again.

**Stop.**

### Step 2 — Detect and run the pipeline

Run the shared pipeline-detection procedure in `Infrastructure/rules/review-pipeline-runner.md`, substituting `<review-type>` = "methodology review".

If the pipeline fails, **stop and do not proceed to the review.** If it succeeds ("Pipeline completed successfully."), continue to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Discover files

Recursively find all files matching these extensions inside `target_dir`:
- `*.py`
- `*.R`
- `*.Rmd`
- `*.qmd`
- `*.do`
- `*.ado`

Exclude files under these subdirectories (relative to `target_dir`):
- `.git/`

Collect the full absolute path of each discovered file.

If zero files are found, stop and respond:

> No reviewable source files found in `<target_dir>`. Expected `.py`, `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`, `.do`, or `.ado` files.

### Step 4 — Report discovery

List the discovered files, grouped by language:

> Found **N** files to review in `<target_dir>`:
>
> **Python (n):** `path/to/file.py`, …
> **R (n):** `path/to/file.R`, …
> **Stata (n):** `path/to/file.do`, …

### Step 5 — Optional context gathering

Ask the user:

> **Optional:** Providing context helps the methodology reviewer give more targeted feedback. You can skip any of these.
>
> 1. **Identification strategy** (e.g., DiD, RD, IV, Matching, OLS/FE) — or leave blank to infer from code
> 2. **Treatment variable** (name in the data)
> 3. **Primary outcome variable(s)**
> 4. **Clustering level** (e.g., county, state, firm)
>
> Reply with the answers, or say "skip" to proceed with code-only inference.

Wait for the user's response. Record any context provided.

### Step 6 — Create output directory

Create the output directory `<target_dir>/review-reports/` if it does not already exist:

```
mkdir -p <target_dir>/review-reports
```

### Step 7 — Spawn the methodology-reviewer sub-agent

Spawn the `methodology-reviewer` sub-agent with the following context:

```
Agent: methodology-reviewer
Target directory: <target_dir>
Files to review: [full list of absolute file paths]
Rules: Infrastructure/rules/methodology-rules.md
Template: Infrastructure/templates/methodology-report.md
Output: <target_dir>/review-reports/methodology-report.html

Research context (if provided by user):
  Identification strategy: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Treatment variable: [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Outcome variable(s): [user input or "Infer from code"]
  Clustering level: [user input or "Infer from code"]
```

### Step 8 — Wait and monitor

Wait for the sub-agent to complete. If the sub-agent reports an error, surface it to the user with the specific message.

### Step 9 — Confirm output and summarize

Verify that `<target_dir>/review-reports/methodology-report.html` exists and is non-empty.

Report to the user:

> Methodology review complete. Report written to `<target_dir>/review-reports/methodology-report.html`.
>
> **Summary:** N findings — X HIGH, X MEDIUM, X LOW
> **Overall Risk:** [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
> **Inferred Design:** [e.g., Difference-in-Differences, staggered]

If HIGH findings are present, add:

> ⚑ **Attention:** [X] HIGH severity concerns were found. These may affect the validity of the identification strategy.

If no findings:

> No significant methodology concerns identified.
